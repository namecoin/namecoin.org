You might have noticed that we've been a bit quiet on this news feed as well as social media for the last month.  Not to worry, there's a reason: same as last year, I (Jeremy Rand) and Jonas Ostman will represent Namecoin at [35C3 (the 35th Chaos Communication Congress)](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) in Leipzig, December 27-30.  And this time, our R&D lab has been very busy cooking up some cool stuff for 35C3, which is why we haven't posted much in the last month.

Once again, we'll be hosted by the Monero Assembly.  The schedule for Monero Assembly events isn't yet finalized, but keep an eye on [the schedule](https://frab.riat.at/en/35C3/public/schedule) for details.  We heard a rumor that talks might get recorded and live-streamed.  We're looking forward to the Congress!
