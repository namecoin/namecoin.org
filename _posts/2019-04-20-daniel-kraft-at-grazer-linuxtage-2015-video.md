Back in 2015, Namecoin Chief Scientist Daniel Kraft gave a German-language talk at Grazer Linuxtage.  A [video of his talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp2V281-AnE) is available for interested viewers.  The video can be viewed via [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) ([Debian package](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/youtube-dl)) ([recommendation by Whonix](https://forums.whonix.org/t/vlc-apparmor-profile-wip-streaming-documentation-for-whonix-install-youtube-dl-by-default/2918)) if you don't trust YouTube's JavaScript (and there's no reason why you should trust YouTube's JavaScript!).
