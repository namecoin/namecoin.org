Namecoin will have a table at the [Oklahoma City Fall Peace Festival 2019](https://peacehouseok.org/outreach/fall-peace-festival/).  The festival is Saturday, November 9, 2019, 10 AM - 4 PM, in the Downtown Civic Center Hall of Mirrors.  If you happen to be near the Oklahoma City area, feel free to come by and say hello.  I *might* even have some cool demos of upcoming features.
