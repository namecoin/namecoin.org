I represented Namecoin at the [2025 Global Conference on Educational Robotics](https://www.kipr.org/gcer) (July 8-12, 2025 in Norman, OK). If you enjoy STEM education talks, this presentation might be up your alley.

Huge thanks to the staff and volunteers from KISS Institute for Practical Robotics, who organized GCER. And in particular a huge thanks to KIPR for publishing videos of the breakout presentations; this is hugely helpful to the community.

This work was funded by Power Up Privacy and NLnet Foundation's NGI0 Core Fund.
