We're happy to announce that Namecoin will have an Assembly at [39C3 (the 39th Chaos Communication Congress)](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) in Hamburg, December 27-30. We will once again be hosted by the [CDC (Critical Decentralization Cluster)](https://decentral.community/).

We expect to give some talks, however, the details are still in flux and will probably not be announced until shortly before the beginning of C3. Keep an eye on both the C3 and CDC websites to find us (or find our absence, if we are unlucky). We heard a rumor that recordings and live-streams may happen as well.

If you'd like to meet up with us at C3, the usual methods (c3nav, etc) should lead you to the CDC and the Namecoin Assembly. Some of us will also be reachable in the #namecoin-dev Matrix channel.

We would like to give a huge thank-you to Power Up Privacy, NLnet Foundation, Cyphrs, RIAT, and Sibermerdeka for facilitating our presence. See you in Hamburg!
