2010-11-14 appamatto came up with an idea on the #bitcoin-dev IRC channel:

23:32 appamatto: I had an idea for a bitcoin-like DNS system. Basically, each generating block allows you to define a new name, and transactions are remappings of the names to ip addresses

00:01 theymos: Why not just generate "domain credits" that allow you to generate a domain, and then transfer those around, too?

He then took the discussion to Bitcointalk: [Bitcointalk: BitDNS and Generalizing Bitcoin](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=1790.0)

Certainly one motivation for BitDNS was fear of Bitcoin related domains being censored. 2010-12-02 [wikileaks.org was troubled.](https://www.theguardian.com/media/blog/2010/dec/03/wikileaks-knocked-off-net-dns-everydns)
