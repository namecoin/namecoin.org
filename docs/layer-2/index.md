Namecoin supports a number of so-called "layer 2" (off-chain) technologies:

* [DNSSEC Delegation]({{ "docs/name-owners/dnssec/" | relative_url }})
* [Name-constrained `TLSA` records]({{ "docs/name-owners/tls/" | relative_url }})

We continue to work on additional layer 2 technologies, such as SegVal.  In addition, as a sidechain, Namecoin itself is a layer 2 technology.
