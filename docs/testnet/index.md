Testnets are a difficult thing to maintain and Namecoin has had someone erroneously dropping a 1 THs miner on it. We [back-ported Bitcoins difficulty](https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin/issues/43) and a new testnet2 blockchain are planned for the future.

A testnet faucet is currently not operational but there is a forum post with a beginning to a xpub/xprv hdw testnet wallet that could be used locally on your computer. [https://forum.namecoin.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2364](https://forum.namecoin.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2364)
