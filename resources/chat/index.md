Developer meetings occur on the 1st and 3rd Sunday of each month at 7 PM UTC.  [An ICS calendar suitable for import into a calendar application (e.g. Icedove) is here.](Namecoin-Development-Meetings.ics)

[Minutes and logs of past developer meetings are available on GitHub.](https://github.com/midnightmagic/namecoin-meeting)
