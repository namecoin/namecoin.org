Ahmed did the initial work in porting Electrum to Namecoin.  The result of Ahmed's work (Electrum-NMC) is currently Namecoin's flagship lightweight SPV wallet.

## Anonymous Developers

We have several developers who prefer to remain anonymous; their anonymity does not reflect the incredible impact their contributions have made to Namecoin. We are deeply grateful for their work.

# Former Developers

We have several developers who are no longer active in the community, listed below.

## Mikhail Sindeyev (thecoder)

Mikhail (then acting under a pseudonym) was our lead C++ developer for roughly a year (prior to Daniel), working on namecoind and creating Namecoin-Qt. Mikhail was a PhD student at Moscow State University. In 2014 Mikhail tragically died of a stroke at the age of 29. His identity was made public shortly after his death so that his great contribution to free speech technology would be recognized.

## Phelix

Phelix (a pseudonym) was community organizer and lead Windows developer. He worked on namecoind, Namecoin-Qt, NMControl, and other projects such as ANTPY. He is mostly retired but occasionally comments from the sidelines.

## Khalahan Henkh (khal)

Khalahan (a pseudonym) was our lead C++ developer for roughly two years (prior to Mikhail), working on namecoind and creating NMControl. Khalahan is currently retired.

## Vincent Durham (vinced)

Vincent (a pseudonym) was the creator of Namecoin, forking Bitcoin’s code to create the first solution to Zooko’s Triangle. Vincent is currently retired.

# Pre-Genesis

Several people contributed research that directly evolved into Vincent Durham's creation of Namecoin.

## Appamatto

Appamatto is the author of the BitDNS and BitX proposals in 2010, which proposed using a Bitcoin-like consensus protocol for non-currency applications such as DNS-like functionality.  BitDNS was later implemented as Namecoin; BitX was later implemented as Ethereum.

## Aaron Swartz

Aaron was the author of the Nakanames proposal in 2011, which was later implemented as Namecoin.  Aaron is well-known for co-creating RSS, Creative Commons, Demand Progress, and Reddit.  Aaron was murdered by the U.S. government in 2013.  The atomic unit of NMC, the *swartz*, is named in Aaron's honor.

## Satoshi Nakamoto

Satoshi invented AuxPoW mining, which he proposed in order to allow BitDNS and Bitcoin to share miners while using separate blockchains.  Satoshi is well-known as the inventor of Bitcoin.
